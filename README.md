# MyAladia Platform part 1
- Hello there, I have documented Demo Screenshots and Video, Storybook screenshots, and necessary documentation.

  
Overview: 
The MyAladia Platform is a feature-rich application built with modular, reusable components. It incorporates modern design principles and integrates seamlessly with tools like NuxtJS and Storybook for streamlined development and documentation.

### Tasks Completed
#### Authentication Components
- Developed a suite of reusable authentication components:

    - Login: A reusable component for user login functionality.
    - Registration: A reusable component for user registration.
    - Forgot Password: A workflow to handle password recovery.
    - Code Verification: A reusable component for code verification during authentication.
    - Password Reset: A component to enable users to reset their passwords.
-  Education Feature
   - Created a dedicated, reusable component (or set of components) 
- Ensured adherence to library best practices for scalability and maintainability.
- Integration with NuxtJS and Storybook
- Set up a new NuxtJS project for seamless development.
- Integrated Storybook to document and provide examples of reusable components.
#### Reusable Components
- Incorporated Element Plus (via the @element-plus/nuxt package) as part of the reusable components strategy.
- Demonstrated effective utilization of external libraries to enhance development efficiency.
### Atomic Design Principles and Design Tokens (Bonus)
 - Applied Atomic Design Principles to ensure components are structured hierarchically:
    - Atoms: Basic building blocks of the UI.
    - Molecules: Combinations of atoms working together.
    - Organisms: Groups of molecules forming distinct sections of the UI.
    Incorporated Design Tokens to maintain consistent styling and theming across the platform.
